**This assessment is based on my personal observations. Since I'm not very active on social media, I may be missing facts, which could render my evaluation incomplete or incorrect.**


## Introduction: My Background and Journey into Bitmap

I am a software developer from Eastern Europe with 15+ years of professional experience in developing enterprise-grade systems. I have firsthand witnessed how a few developers team under effective management, grew into a multi-million valuation international company. 

I do not belong to any cults nor do I choose sides; I use social media only when necessary for professional purposes. In my free time, I explore the world of cryptocurrencies. I recognize potential when I see it and prefer long-term utility over short-lived memes and trends.

I was introduced to Bitmap by TheBlockRunner, realizing its potential, I secured a few promising pieces and stepped back, leaving the area to mature until standards and frameworks were established. 


## The Importance of Leadership

Based on my experience, strong and competent leadership is crucial for success. Perhaps I'm overlooking something, but I didn't observe such leadership emerge within the Bitmap community. I wouldn't rely solely on Bitoshi to advance the initiative. From my perspective, Bitoshi appears to be a young soul who unexpectedly found himself at the forefront of a major NFT movement. Frankly, I don't perceive him as an tallented leader, nor does he appear to possess exceptional technical skills.

I'm not trying to downplay Bitoshi's contributions; his vision sparked the entire Bitmap movement, but it seems unfair to place such a huge responsibility on one person. His vision was a huge spark, and resonated with many, but people are shortsighted and have short memories. The initial excitement has faded, and the project is in decline.

I'm not aware of any other Bitcoin project that matches Bitmap in terms of expansive utility and visionary scope. Yet, it remains overshadowed by JPEGs and meme coins.

We boast about having over 30K supporters, but their presence isn't strongly felt. Almost a year has passed, and the Bitmap community has little to show for. The fragmentation is evident not only in the lack of unified action but also in the inconsistency of fundamental knowledge. For instance, ask what the metaverse is, and each Bitmap owner will likely give you a different answer. This disparity highlights a critical need for stronger leadership and cohesive strategy within the community.


## Proposal for a New Organization

To resolve current ambiguities and unite the Bitmap community, establishing a formal organization is crucial. We could call this entity Bitmap Assembly, Council, or Committee, though I personally prefer Bitmap Bureau. This organization would play a pivotal role in centralizing decision-making, setting clear goals, and ensuring that all community efforts are aligned towards a common vision. It would also act as the official voice of the Bitmap community, providing a structured platform for communication and collaboration.

The Bitmap Council (BC) would be comprised of proactive and dedicated community members who are committed to advancing the vision of Bitmap. Membership in the BC would be dynamic; members could be added or removed by a supermajority vote, ensuring adaptability and responsiveness to the community's needs. If Bitoshi agrees, he could lead the organization, enjoying immunity and veto powers.

Members of the BC would engage in weekly meetings. These sessions would focus on discussing current issues, brainstorming new ideas, strategizing future directions, and planning actionable steps.


**Main Functions of the Bitmap Council:**

- **Standardization**: Establish and maintain a unified set of terminologies and standards across all Bitmap activities to ensure consistency and clarity.
- **Vision and Roadmapping**: Clearly define and regularly update a strategic vision and roadmap, keeping the entire Bitmap community well-informed and aligned with common goals.
- **Project Oversight**: Rigorously review all Bitmap-related projects to endorse those that are promising and valuable, while also identifying and issuing warnings about potential fraudulent schemes.
- **Resource Management**: Oversee and manage open-source Bitmap solutions and repositories.
- **Partnership Coordination**: Effectively coordinate and communicate with external partners to foster collaborations.
 **Education and Outreach**: Launch educational programs and outreach to increase understanding and engagement with Bitmap protocol.
- **Community Engagement**: Facilitate regular interactions with the community via forums and social media to foster involvement and gather feedback.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure all Bitmap activities comply with current legal and regulatory frameworks.
