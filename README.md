## Where to Purchase

All my parcels are inscribed and tapped before they put on sale on Magic Eden. You can use the following link to make a purchase:

- [Magic Eden Marketplace](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/wallet?walletAddress=bc1q92gfgnatumqn0ly5dsd3ufzehxk7s486d5fx5m)

To verify the status of any parcel, check out:

- [Bitmap Land Verification](https://bitmap.land/?block=555555)

Please be cautious when considering purchases from other sources, as they may be untapped and, consequently, not officially recognized.
