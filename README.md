Welcome to the official #Bitmap #District5 repository. Our primary offering is a distinctively named parcel, valued higher than any ordinary district. While the future holds many possibilities, a well-named parcel stands as a testament to potential and prestige. 


## Where to Purchase

All our parcels are inscribed and tapped before they put on sale on Magic Eden. You can use the following link to make a purchase:

- [Magic Eden Marketplace](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/wallet?walletAddress=bc1q92gfgnatumqn0ly5dsd3ufzehxk7s486d5fx5m)

To verify the status of any parcel, check out:

- [Bitmap Land Verification](https://bitmap.land/?block=555555)

Please be cautious when considering purchases from other sources, as they may be untapped and, consequently, not officially recognized.

## Explanation for Claiming the Name #District5

The name "District5" was claimed because it is associated with "555555.bitmap," which uniquely allows for the management of multiple parcels, specifically 2,356 parcels. This distinction is crucial as the numerical progression from "5.bitmap" to "555555.bitmap" represents a scaling in capability and scope, with only "555555.bitmap" reaching the threshold where it can be considered a district due to its capacity to encompass a substantial number of parcels. The identifiers preceding "555555.bitmap" are limited to a single parcel each and, therefore, do not qualify as districts.

| Bitmap ID     | Parcels       | Qualification          |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 5.bitmap      | 1 parcel      | Cannot be a district   |
| 55.bitmap     | 1 parcel      | Cannot be a district   |
