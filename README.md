Welcome to the official #Bitmap #District5 on #BTC Orange Pages — The Million Dollar Homepage for #Inscriptions OGs, Gallery Owners, Traders, Influencers, and #Bitmap Enthusiasts. Our primary offering is a distinctively named parcel, valued higher than any ordinary district. While the future holds many possibilities, a well-named parcel stands as a testament to potential and prestige.


## Where to Purchase

At the start, a select few of our parcels may be temporarily available for purchase. Each is inscribed and verified before being listed for sale on Magic Eden. Availability may change in the future, so if you’re lucky, you can use the following link to make a purchase:

- [Magic Eden Marketplace](https://magiceden.io/ordinals/wallet?walletAddress=bc1q92gfgnatumqn0ly5dsd3ufzehxk7s486d5fx5m)

To verify the status of any parcel, check out:

- [Bitmap Land Verification](https://bitmap.land/?block=555555)

Please be cautious when considering purchases from other sources, as they may be untapped and, consequently, not officially recognized.

## Explanation for Naming #District5

The name 'District5' was chosen for 555555.bitmap because it encompasses a large number of parcels—specifically, 2,356. This sets it apart from earlier single-digit 5 bitmaps such as 5.bitmap or 55.bitmap, which manage only one parcel and therefore cannot be classified as a district.

| Bitmap ID     | Parcels       | Qualification          |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| 5.bitmap      | 1 parcel      | Cannot be a district   |
| 55.bitmap     | 1 parcel      | Cannot be a district   |
| 555.bitmap    | 1 parcel      | Cannot be a district   |
| 5555.bitmap   | 1 parcel      | Cannot be a district   |
| 55555.bitmap  | 1 parcel      | Cannot be a district   |
| 555555.bitmap | 2,356 parcels | District5 (qualifies)  |
